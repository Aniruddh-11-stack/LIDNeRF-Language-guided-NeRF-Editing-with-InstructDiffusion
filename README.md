#### Abstract:
The project introduces a novel method for instruction-based image editing by leveraging the combined capabilities of InstructDiffusion and Lang-SAM models. This approach allows for precise and context-aware modifications to real-world images based on natural language instructions. The core methodology involves an iterative process where images rendered from NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) scenes are updated using diffusion models and then used to supervise the reconstruction of these scenes. This iterative process enables targeted edits such as object addition, removal, and replacement, while optimizing the underlying 3D scene. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through various qualitative results, showcasing its versatility and ability to perform complex image edits compared to previous techniques.
